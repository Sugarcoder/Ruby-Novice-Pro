# We can include enumerable modules into our own classes to gain more functionality.

# The Class must contain the "each" method.

# If you want to write codes once and share it between unrelated classes, 
# you can put it in modules to be “mixed in” with your classes.


# Example:

# Using the Array "each" method = contains collect, detect, find, find_all, include?, max, min, sort, to_a

# Example of "collect": [1,2,3,4].collect { |i| i.to_s + "x" }
