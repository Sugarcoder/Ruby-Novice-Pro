# Comparable module  provides methods that give other classes comparison operators such as <, <=, ==, =>, >, 
# and "between?" (returns true if the value is between the two parameters provided. 

# Comparable module uses <=> operator on the classes that include it. 
# <=> returns -1 if the provided parameter is higher than the object's value, 0 if they are equal and 1 if the value is higher than the parameter.


# Example: 
1 <=> 2     # Answer is -1
1 <=> 1     # Answer is 0 
2 <=> 1     # Answer is 1
