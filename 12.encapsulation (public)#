# You could put "private" before one method, and then revert back to public methods again after using "public".

# Example:


class Princess
  def this_is_public
     ...
  end
  

private

   def this_is_private
      ...
   end
   

public

   def this_is_public_again
      ...
   end
   
end



# You can use "private" as a command by putting in symbols representing the methods you want to keep private.


# Example: 

class Princess
   
   def this_is_public; ...; end
   
   
   def this_is_private; ...; end
   
   def this_is_private_again; ...; end
   
   def this_is_public_again; ...; end
   
   
   
   
private :this_is_private, :this_is_private_again           

end


# "private" has to come after the methods are defined. 





# Ruby supports lines of code ending with ";" and allows you to put multiple lines of code on a single line.

# Example: 

x = 10; x +=1; puts x
