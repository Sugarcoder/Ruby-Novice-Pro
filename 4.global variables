# Global variables are available from everywhere within an application,
# including inside classes and objects. 

# Global variable is not commonly used in Ruby.


# You define global variables by using the "$" sign. 


# Example: 

def basic_method
  puts x
end


$x = 10 
basic_method    

# Answer will be 10


# $ and @ characters that denote global characters are called "sigils".
