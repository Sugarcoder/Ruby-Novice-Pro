# Modules = You can share functionality between different classes. 

# Modules can be included into other classes. 

# Example:


module Brains
   def class_name
      self.class.to_s 
   end
end


class Zombies
   include Brains
end


x = Zombies.new
puts x.class_name




# Modules are like a tab within a folder. 

# It is similar to Classes, but used as a way to organize things..

# So if Brains is a tab, it is in the Zombies folder.
