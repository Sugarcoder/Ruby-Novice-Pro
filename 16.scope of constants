# Constants = Special variables that do not change and are permanent throughout an application.
# Ex. Pi = 3.14...


# Constants are defined within the scope of the current class and available to all child classes.

# Example:

Pi = 3.14

class Apple_Pie
   Pi = 4.5                            # Apple_Pie has its own definition of Pi. If you removed it, Pi would be 3.14 (defined globally)
  
   def Apple_Pie.circumference(radius)
      radius * 2 * Pi
   end
   
end


puts Apple_Pie.circumference(10)       # Answer will be 90.0
